\section{DeltaRho Stack Cluster Installation Guide}
\subsection{Introduction}
This guide is intended to be used by the Systems Administrator to quickly
install and configure the software necessary to run the full Tessera
stack on a multi-node cluster.  It is not focused on tuning and optimally
configuring the Tessera stack.  Most components of Tessera require no
tuning.  However, the Systems Administrator is encouraged to consult the
Cloudera Hadoop documentation for further tuning of Hadoop and HDFS.

\subsection{Example Configuration}
Running the DeltaRho stack on a Hadoop cluster requires each Hadoop node
to be configured to fill one or more of the roles of ResourceManager,
NameNode, Secondary NameNode, DataNode, and NodeManager. The role
descriptions are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item NameNode - Manages the directory tree and metadata of the Hadoop File System (HDFS), a distributed virtual file system that allows data to be replicated and stored across many nodes in the cluster.
\item SecondaryNameNode - Offloads HDFS checkpoint support for the NameNode.  It is not a NameNode failover or backup as the name may imply.
\item ResourceManager - Schedules and issues map reduce jobs for NodeManagers across the cluster.
\item DataNode - Stores data on the local drives of nodes as part of the distributed HDFS.  DataNodes are almost always also NodeManagers.
\item NodeManager - Executes the map and reduce jobs issued by the ResourceManager. NodeManagers are almost always also DataNodes.
\end{itemize}

There can be just one NameNode, one ResourceManager, and one Secondary
NameNode, but there will be many DataNodes and NodeManagers.  The node
acting as NameNode cannot also be the Secondary NameNode, but could
perform one or more of other roles of ResourceManager, DataNode, and
NodeManager with a potential  performance penalty.  Most cluster nodes
will be compute nodes with multiple hard drives and thus will run both
the DataNode and NodeManager services.

For our example we will have a single front-end server that acts as the
R-session server.  It is where we will run R, which in turn runs RHIPE.
The front-end server is aware of our Hadoop configuration and can issue
Hadoop commands, though it isn't technically a Hadoop node itself. The
front-end server will also be our Shiny server and optional Rstudio
server.  We will have five nodes in our example Hadoop cluster.  Each of
the Hadoop nodes in the cluster has a fully qualified domain
name of the form \verb|nodeNNN.example.com|. In our example,

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|node001.example.com| will be the NameNode and the ResourceManager.
\item \verb|node002.example.com| will be the Secondary NameNode, a NodeManager, and a DataNode.
\item \verb|node003.example.com| to \verb|node005.example.com| will be NodeManagers and DataNodes.
\item \verb|frontend.example.com| will be the front end R-session server, the Shiny server, and optional Rstudio Server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Packages}
\subsubsection{Required Packages}
The DeltaRho stack consists of some packages provided by the DeltaRho group and some provided by other sources. \\

\textbf{Packages provided by the DeltaRho group}
\begin{enumerate}
\item RHIPE - 0.75.1.4
\item datadr
\item trelliscope
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Packages provided by others}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sun/Oracle Java - 7
\item Protocol Buffers - 2.5.0
\item Cloudera Hadoop version cdh5.3.3
\item R - 3.1.3
\item rJava - 0.9-6
\item R packages - codetools, ggplot2, lattice, boot, shiny, devtools
\item Shiny server
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Optional Packages}
These optional packages can be installed along with the DeltaRho stack providing convenience for the analyst.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rstudio server - Rstudio server creates a persistent interactive R session for the analyst by running R on a remote server and providing access through a the analyst's local browser.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\subsection{Installation}
Some packages need only be installed on the Hadoop nodes, some need only
be installed on the frontend server, and some must be installed on both.
This is specified on a per-package basis below. This guide is command
line friendly.

\subsubsection{Compilers and development tools (all servers)}
Some of the software to be installed must be compiled from source, so a
typical set of compilers (gcc, gfortran) and development tools must
be installed first.  This can be done by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Java (all servers)} (\url{http://www.java.com/en/})\\
Oracle Java is downloaded from www.java.com for 64-bit RHEL by browsing to:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Check the ``Accept License Agreement'' radio box, then click the
jdk-7u79-linux-x64.rpm link (or newer version if available) and save.
Cd to the directory where it was downloaded and type the following to install
the Java JDK, changing the filename to match the filename downloaded
if necessary:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo rpm -ivh jdk-7u79-linux-x64.rpm
\end{verbatim}

Next, tell Red Hat that the newly installed Oracle Java is the default
version to use, even if other versions of Java like OpenJDK were
previously installed:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/latest/bin/java 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/java/latest/bin/javac 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/javadoc javadoc /usr/java/latest/bin/javadoc 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/javah javah /usr/java/latest/bin/javah 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/javap javap /usr/java/latest/bin/javap 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/javaws javaws /usr/java/latest/bin/javaws 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/libjavaplugin.so libjavaplugin.so.x86_64 /usr/java/latest/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so 200005
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /usr/java/latest/bin/jar 200005
\end{verbatim}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Don't do this?
%Java environment variables are added to the user environment for future logins.
%\begin{verbatim}
%echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
%export JAVA_BIN=\$JAVA_HOME/bin
%export PATH=\$PATH:\$JAVA_HOME:\$JAVA_BIN" |
%sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/profile.d/java.sh"
%\end{verbatim}
%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Protocol Buffers (all servers)} (\url{https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/})\\
Install Protocol Buffers.  It is important that version 2.5.0 be installed
and not a newer or older version.  Note that certain other packages
to be installed later rely on the pkg-config program, which should
already exist on Red Hat.  The pkg-config program expects that newly
installed programs register themselves by placing \emph{programname}.pc files in
/usr/lib64/pkgconfig, which is why there is a \verb|--libdir=/usr/lib64|
in the instructions below.  To install, first cd to a directory where
the software can be downloaded and built, and type the following.

\begin{verbatim}
wget https://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/v2.5.0.zip
unzip v2.5.0.zip
cd protobuf-2.5.0
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=/usr/lib64
make
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Hadoop (all servers)} (\url{http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cdh.html})\\
We use the Hadoop distribution built by Cloudera.  It is a Hadoop MRv2 /
YARN implementation.  Download the Cloudera repo definition and install
it so we can install Cloudera packages directly using yum.  Then update
yum so it is aware of the packages available on the Cloudera repository.

\begin{verbatim}
wget http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/redhat/6/x86_64/cdh/cloudera-cdh5.repo
sudo cp cloudera-cdh5.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum update
\end{verbatim}

We install different Hadoop packages on each node based on the Hadoop roles
played by that node.  After installing each set of packages we will configure
them to be started automatically at boot time using \verb|chkconfig|.

node001.example.com:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager hadoop-hdfs-namenode hadoop-client
sudo chkconfig hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager on
sudo chkconfig hadoop-hdfs-namenode on
\end{verbatim}

node002.example.com:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install hadoop-hdfs-secondarynamenode hadoop-yarn-nodemanager
sudo yum install hadoop-hdfs-datanode hadoop-mapreduce
sudo chkconfig hadoop-hdfs-secondarynamenode on
sudo chkconfig hadoop-yarn-nodemanager on
sudo chkconfig hadoop-hdfs-datanode on
\end{verbatim}

node003.example.com through node005.example.com:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install hadoop-yarn-nodemanager hadoop-hdfs-datanode hadoop-mapreduce
sudo chkconfig hadoop-yarn-nodemanager on
sudo chkconfig hadoop-hdfs-datanode on
\end{verbatim}

frontend.example.com (doesn't run any hadoop services, but needs the hadoop commands):
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install hadoop-client
\end{verbatim}

As part of the above steps, three new users and groups named yarn, hdfs,
and mapred will be added to the system.  All three users are added to
the new group hadoop.

Configuration of Hadoop settings is done in another section, but for now
we will prepare the configuration directory and set it as the default
Hadoop configuration on the system.  On each of node001 through node005
and on the frontend, execute the following.  We choose the configuration
directory name of "conf.deltarho" in this guide:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo cp -r /etc/hadoop/conf.empty /etc/hadoop/conf.deltarho
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /etc/hadoop/conf hadoop-conf /etc/hadoop/conf.deltarho 50
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --set hadoop-conf /etc/hadoop/conf.deltarho
\end{verbatim}

Add Hadoop environment variables and an updated path to the user
environment for future logins.  This assumes users use an sh/ksh/bash/zsh
based login shell.

\begin{verbatim}
echo "export HADOOP=/usr/lib/hadoop
export HADOOP_HOME=\$HADOOP
export HADOOP_BIN=\$HADOOP/bin
export HADOOP_LIB=\$HADOOP/lib
export HADOOP_LIBS=\`hadoop classpath | tr -d \\*\`
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf.deltarho
export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce
export HADOOP_HDFS_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs
export YARN_HOME=/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn
export PATH=\$PATH:\$HADOOP_BIN" |
sudo bash -c "cat > /etc/profile.d/hadoop.sh"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{R (all nodes)} (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/})\\
R is installed and configured to know about Java.  Install the Red Hat
provided blas and lapack packages first for extra performance.  Cd to
a directory where the software can be downloaded and compiled and type:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install blas blas-devel lapack lapack-devel
wget http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.3.tar.gz
tar zxvf R-3.1.3.tar.gz
cd R-3.1.3
./configure --with-blas --with-lapack --with-x --enable-R-shlib
make
sudo make install
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R CMD javareconf
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{rJava (all nodes)}(\url{http://www.rforge.net/rJava/})\\
rJava is also required by RHIPE.  It is installed by:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('rJava', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{RHIPE (all nodes)}(\url{http://deltarho.org/})\\
RHIPE is downloaded and installed.
\begin{verbatim}
wget http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/rhipebin/Rhipe_0.75.1.4_cdh5.tar.gz
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R CMD INSTALL Rhipe_0.75.1.4_cdh5.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{datadr and trelliscope support packages (all nodes)}(\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available\_packages\_by\_name.html})\\
Additional R packages - codetools, latttice, ggplot2, boot, shiny and devtools are needed for trelliscope and datadr. They are installed using the R internal package installer \verb|install.packages|. Use the command line to enter the following commands.
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install libcurl-devel
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('ggplot2', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('lattice', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('RCurl', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('shiny', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "install.packages('devtools', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{datadr and trelliscope (all nodes)}(\url{http://deltarho.org})\\
datadr and trelliscope are installed using install\_github package from R.
\begin{verbatim}
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "options(repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com/');\
 library(devtools); install_github('delta-rho/datadr')"
sudo env PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH R -e "options(repos = 'http://cran.rstudio.com/');\
 library(devtools); install_github('delta-rho/trelliscope')"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Shiny server (frontend server)}(\url{http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/})\\

Shiny server is only installed on frontend.example.com, our designated
Shiny server. The following commands will install the software
and launch the Shiny server.

\begin{verbatim}
wget http://download3.rstudio.org/centos-5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.3.0.403-rh5-x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.3.0.403-rh5-x86_64.rpm
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Rstudio Server (frontend server)}(\url{http://www.rstudio.com/})\\
Rstudio Server is installed on just the shiny server,
frontend.example.com.  The following commands will install the software
and launch Rstudio server.
\begin{verbatim}
sudo yum install openssl098e
wget http://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-0.98.1103-x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install --nogpgcheck rstudio-server-0.98.1103-x86_64.rpm
\end{verbatim}

Test Rstudio server by browsing to \url{http://frontend.example.com:8787}
and logging in as a normal user with accounts on that server.  This may
require firewall changes.
